# Full Site Mockup

A site created just for training myself and learning programming. Elements I wanted to showcase:
- responsive `navbar` with `position: sticky`,
- `cta button`, which causes a new `DIV` to appear, moving the whole page down,
- embedding `iframe` from YouTube,
- use of `prefers-color-scheme`,
- using `flex` and `grid` layouts,
- `modal`
